# Bookmark tree server repository
The bookmark manager consists of two parts - web application and chrome extension. This repository contains the server part. 
For chrome extension part [see](https://github.com/olpapchenko/bookmark-tree-chrome-extension).
With the Bookmark tree extension, you can create new bookmarks, create comments on arbitrary web-pages, make associations between pages, and mark some text.
Also, this extension can create a summary of the text on the page using the TextRank algorithm.

### Features:
- Create comments
- Make links from bookmarked page to other pages, thus making a tree-like structure
- Share your bookmarks with other users
